#About this workshop


##Main Goal

To learn about how to solve common programming problems and create back-end services using Node.js.


##Short description

Learn about JavaScript and asynchronous programming, flow control, event emitters and streams â€” master the basic patterns so that you can use Node.js and some surrounding libraries to solve real problems, create useful APIs and offer real-time services.


##Who should attend

People with some experience with programming. Experience in JavaScript programming is nice, but not a requirement. Experience with Node.js is definitely not a requirement.


##Requirements

Bring your own laptop
Have latest Node.js or IO.js installed
Have a text editor installed
